# Problem Solving

A. Understand the problem:

- This is a crucial first step. It's important to have a clear understanding of the problem before attempting to solve it. Make sure you grasp all the details and requirements.
  - Can i restate the problem in my own words?
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
  - Do i have enough information to solve the problem?
  - How should i label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

B. Explore concrete examples:

- Examining concrete examples can help you gain insights into the problem and identify patterns. It's a good practice to start with specific cases to understand the problem's nuances.
  - Start with simple examples
  - progress to more complex examples
  - explore examples with empty inputs
  - explore examples with invalid inputs

C. Break it down:

- Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts is an effective strategy. It makes the problem more approachable and helps you focus on solving one piece at a time.

D. Solve/Simplify:

- This is where the actual problem-solving takes place. You work on solving the smaller parts or simplifying the problem to make it more manageable. Make sure to apply appropriate techniques or algorithms at this stage.

E. Look back and refactor:

- Reflecting on your solution is crucial. This step allows you to review your approach, identify potential improvements, and optimize your solution. Refactoring is especially important for code-based problem-solving.
