| Data Structure | Operation | Explanation                                 |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Array          | Access    | Retrieve the element at index `base + i`    |
| Linked List    | Traversal | Traverse the list to locate the 4th element |

In optimized algorithms, a Linked List can outperform an Array, particularly when quickly locating data. Insertion and deletion costs are relatively consistent, unlike Arrays, which require shifting data for these operations.

| Characteristic | Array                                               | Linked List                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory Usage   | Contiguous block, potential for wasted space        | Dynamic allocation, more memory-efficient           |
| Performance    | Fast random access, slower insertions and deletions | Fast insertions and deletions, slower random access |
