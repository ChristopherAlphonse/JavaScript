# Linked Lists

## Pros of Linked Lists

- Nodes can easily be removed or added from a linked list without reorganizing the entire data structure. This is one advantage it has over arrays.

## Cons of Linked Lists

- Search operations are slow in linked lists. Unlike arrays, random access of data elements is not allowed. Nodes are accessed sequentially starting from the first node.
- It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage of the pointers.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are three types of linked lists:

- Singly Linked Lists: Each node contains only one pointer to the next node. This is what we have been talking about so far.
- Doubly Linked Lists: Each node contains two pointers, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.
- Circular Linked Lists: Circular linked lists are a variation of a linked list in which the last node points to the first node or any other node before it, thereby forming a loop.
